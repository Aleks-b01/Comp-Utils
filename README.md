Comp Utils is a personal project that I started, which will essentially contain Utilities for Cube Comps (wow crazy i know),
basic stuff like a scramble generator, helper tools (similar to cstimer helper tools), alg trainer, and a bpa, wpa, target and avg calculator.
I won't be accepting any pull requests as this is a personal project and is supposed to be a learning experience for me, but feel free to fork it.
